Welcome to your Nas-Manager project (built on Cloud9 IDE!)

## What is Nas-Manager

    Work In Progress
Imagined for Raspberry PI Nas-Manager will transform your RPI into a real NAS with Node.JS

The project has three main areas of development :
    - Ease of use
    - Power and Fast
    - Modular and Maintainable

Naturally, the NAS-Management solution contains all the basic functions and the advanced functions by default the most experienced initially.
And later by the "Modularity" project, the solution may be more complete.
Modules developed by communot√© will see the day in addition to those developed by the original team that created the NAS-Management solution.
