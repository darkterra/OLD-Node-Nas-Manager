Welcome to your Node-Nas-Management (NNM) project (built on Cloud9 IDE!)

## What is Node-Nas-Management (NNM) ?

    Work In Progress
Imagined for Raspberry PI, Node-Nas-Management will transform your RPI into a real NAS with Node.JS

Node-Nas-Management is the first manager to NAS in Node.JS. Designed and built for Raspberry PI, but also suitable for Linux / Windows / Mac.

The project has three main areas of development :

* Ease of use
* Power and Fast
* Modular and Maintainable

Naturally, the Node-Nas-Management solution contains all the basic functions and the advanced functions by default the most experienced initially.
And later by the "Modularity" project, the solution may be more complete.
Modules developed by community will see the day in addition to those developed by the original team that created the Node-NAS-Management solution.

Node-NAS-Management is a Rich Web Client based EXTJS technology (that provides a desktop interface imitation) and Resumable.js
(beautiful JavaScript library providing multiple simultaneous, stable and resumable uploads via the HTML5 File API).

######This project is fully open source.
